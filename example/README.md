## example

This folder contains example iRules and a JSON files used in the [example workflows](../.github/workflows/).

### iRules

The [`irules`](./irules) folder contains several iRules.

The iRule `irules/wrong_extension.txt` will not be scanned as the file extension does not match the default extensions (`.tcl`, `.irul`, `.irule`).

### YAML files

The file `expected_results.json` contains the expected output generated by a irulescan-action run with `scandir:` set to `example/`.

The file `results_dont_match.json` is incomplete and used to demo a non-expected result.
